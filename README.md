# YOIFITS

This project provides support for OI-FITS (optical interferometry data format) in
[Yorick](http://github.com/LLNL/yorick/).

[Installation](#installation) is explained below.


## Usage

If properly installed, the software exploits the *auto-load* facility of Yorick
so that there are no needs to `#include "oifits.i"`.


### Dealing with an existing OI-FITS file

First, load OI-FITS data from a file:

```c
ws = oifits_load(filename);
```

where `ws` is the *handle* to manipulate the contents of the OI-FITS file and
`filename` is the name of the OI-FITS file.

OI-FITS data is stored in a collection of FITS header data units (HDU).  This
structure is reproduced by the plugin where a data-block correspond to a FITS
HDU.  In order to access the OI-FITS contents, you have to select a specific
data-block.  For instance, you can loop over all the data-blocks of the handle
`ws` with:

```c
for (db = oifits_first(ws); db; db = oifits_next(ws, db)) {
    ...;
}
```

where `db` is another kind of handle but to a specific data-block this time.

In the loop, the function `oifits_is_data` can be used to check whether a given
data-block contains interferometric data (true for `OI_VIS`, `OI_VIS2` and
`OI_T3` data-blocks).

There are many functions to access the contents of a given data-block.  Again,
the OI-FITS structure of a HDU is reproduced and the general syntax to query a
specific field is:

```c
oifits_get_FIELDNAME(ws, db);
```

where `FIELDNAME` is the name of the OI-FITS field which is the same as the
corresponding FITS keyword or column in lowercase letters and with non
alphanumerical characters replaced by an underscore `_`.  For instance, to
query the effective wavelength, just do:

```c
oifits_get_eff_wave(ws, db);
```

where `db` is an `OI_WAVELENGTH`, `OI_VIS`, `OI_VIS2` or `OI_T3` data-block of
OI-FITS instance `ws`.  The reasons that you have to provide both `ws` and `db`
are that some information (as the effective wavelength) of the data-block `db`
may be stored in an other data-block of the same OI-FITS instance `ws` and
Yorick does not allow circular references.

The following is applicable to all data-blocks:

### Creating a new OI-FITS file

In order to create a new OI-FITS file, you first create a new OI-FITS handle in
Yorick, then you populate it with data-blocks and, finally, you save it to the
disk.

To create a new OI-FITS instance:

```c
ws = oifits_new();
```

To add data-blocks:

```c
oifits_insert, ws, db1, db2, ...;
```

where `db1`, `db2`, *etc.* are OI-FITS data-blocks which have been freshly
created (see below) or which are borrowed from another OI-FITS instance.

To create a new data-block, the general syntax is:

```c
db = oifits_new_DBTYPE(key1=val1, key2=val2, ...);
```

where `DBTYPE` is the data-block type (`target`, `array`, `wavelength`,
`spectrum`, `vis`, `vis2` or `t3`) and all fields of the data-block are passed
by keyword.  Note that all fields must be specified.  See the individual
documentation of the data-block constructors to figure out which fields are
required.  For instance:

```c
help, oifits_new_vis2;
```

Optionally, the OI-FITS instance to which insert the new data-block can be
specified in a data-block constructor:

```c
oifits_new_DBTYPE, ws, key1=val1, key2=val2, ...;
```

is the same as:

```c
oifits_insert, ws, oifits_new_DBTYPE(key1=val1, key2=val2, ...);
```

There may be any number of data-blocks in an OI-FITS instance and they may be
inserted at any time and in any order.  After inserting the data-blocks, it is
necessary to make sure that the internals of the OI-FITS instance are consistent
(otherwise some functionalities may not work as expected).  Updating internal
information is done by:

```c
oifits_update, ws;
```

Saving an OI-FITS instance to a file is as simple as:

```c
oifits_save, ws, filename;
```

where `filename` is the name of the OI-FITS file.  The `oifits_save` subroutine
has a number of keywords to add comments, history records or to allow
overwritting an existing file (which is forbidden by default).


### Simulated Data

If the contents of an OI-FITS data-block correspond to model data, you may
simulate additive noise with:

```c
out = oifits_add_noise(ws, method, level);
```

which has the effect of adding noise to all `OI_VIS`, `OI_VIS2` or `OI_T3`
data-blocks of the OI-FITS instance `ws` and returns a new OI-FITS instance.
The other arguments are as follows:

* `method = 1` or `"generate"` to add noise to noiseless data; the standard
  deviation of the noise is taken from the contents of `ws`; in this case,
  the `level` argument must be undefined or omitted.

* `method = 2` or `"snr"` to add noise to noiseless data; the standard
  deviation of noise is computed to achieve a signal-to-noise ratio equal to
  the value of `level`.

* `method = 3` or `"amplify"` to add noise to noisy data so that the standard
  deviation of total noise (existing one plus added one) is multiplied by the
  value of `level` which must be greater or equal one.  The standard deviation
  of the noise prior to the amplification is taken from the contents of `ws`.

The operation can also be carried out *in-place* by calling `oifits_add_noise`
as a subroutine:

```c
oifits_add_noise, ws, method, level;
```


## Installation

### Installation with EasyYorick

Installation of YOIFITS by [EasyYorick](https://github.com/emmt/EasyYorick) is
fully supported.  Assuming you have installed EasyYorick, you just have to
execute:

```sh
ypkg install yorick yeti yoifits
```

which should install Yorick, Yeti (if not yet installed) and YOIFITS.

To upgrade to the last master version:

```sh
ypkg upgrade yoifits
```


### Manual installation

1. You must have [Yorick](http://github.com/LLNL/yorick/) and
   [Yeti](https://github.com/emmt/Yeti) installed on your machine.

2. Unpack the [software code](https://github.com/emmt/YOIFITS/archive/master.zip)
   somewhere or clone the Git repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/emmt/YOIFITS.git yoifits
   ```

   if you want/prefer to use HTTPS, or:

   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:emmt/YOIFITS.git yoifits
   ```

   if you want/prefer to use SSH.  Any of these commands creates a local GIT
   repository named `yoifits`.


3. Configure for compilation.  There are two possibilities (the first one is
   recommended):

   - For an **out-of-place build**, create a dedicated build directory, say
     `$BUILD_DIR`, go to the build directory and run the configuration script:

     ```sh
     mkdir -p $BUILD_DIR
     cd $BUILD_DIR
     $SRC_DIR/configure
     ```

     where `$SRC_DIR` is the path to the source directory of the plug-in code.
     To see the configuration options, type:

     ```sh
     $SRC_DIR/configure --help
     ```

   - For an **in-place build**, go to the source directory, say `$SRC_DIR`, of
     the plug-in code and run the configuration script:

     ```sh
     cd $SRC_DIR
     ./configure
     ```

     To see the configuration options, type:

     ```sh
     ./configure --help
     ```

4. Compile the code:

   ```sh
   make clean
   make
   ```

5. Install YOIFITS (you must have write access granted to Yorick directories):

   ```sh
   make install
   ```
